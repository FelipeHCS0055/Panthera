<p align="center">
    A Motorcycle Telemetry system with the goal of implementing a full digital twin for racing analysis
  and design, developed by students of the EESC - USP university in Brazil. Including a 3D visualization terminal 
    for movement and forces, as well as a built-in processing suite to compute unmeasurable variables.
